Online Ecommerce Shoe Website 
The purpose of the project is to build a web application program for an online shoe store. The online shoe store enables the customer to browse our range of products and services, view photos or images of the products, along with information about the product specifications, features and prices. Customers should be able to easily maneuver through our website by clicking on the menu sidebar.  In addition, customers will be able to subscribe to a newsletter of new products and special offers in selected catalogue categories. Moreover, users should be able to access the site from mobile phones and widescreen monitors as our site will have a esponsive look of our online store for the narrowest mobile phones up to widescreen monitors.
